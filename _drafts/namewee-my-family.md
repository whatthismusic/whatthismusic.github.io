"My Family", is the OST to Namewee's upcoming movie, "BABI" and it features both 5Forty2 and The Real Masta Clan (_previously known as Ashtaka_). This is not their first collaboration though. They have worked together on other Namewee's songs such as [Wake UP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRqMCxare2A){:target="_blank"}, [We Are Gangster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekc1Ctdg_nQ){:target="_blank"} and [BANGLASIA Gong Xi Fa Cai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUCv-rP91K4){:target="_blank"}. This song is also nominated in Taipei's Golden Horse Film Festival (2020) in the "Best Original Film Song" category [^1].

It starts with a children's song sang in a mystical way giving the listeners an eerie feeling. It is clever how it is used not only to set the mood of the song but also as a way to transition to each of their respective parts.

The song has a very strong message with regards to the education system in Malaysia. This is something that most Malaysians who have gone through the public education system can relate to. I believe the three of them have done well to convey their own perspective on the matter. To know more about the story behind the song, you can watch The Making of "Happy Family" by Namewee below.

5Forty2 has also recorded a video whereby Phonic, DMent and NanaMerah explained the meaning behind each of their parts in the song.

Malaysians will have to find alternative means to watch the film "BABI" as it will not be screened in cinemas in Malaysia. In some interviews he did in Taiwan [^2], he mentioned that he didn't apply for it knowing it will not be approved [^3].

Although there are some who applaud him for speaking the truth on the topic, there are also those who see both the song and film as a national threat and police reports have been lodged [^4][^5].

Namewee is no stranger to controversy from his work and having his works banned, not only in Malaysia [^6][^7]. He is a talented singer, song writer, performer, film director, etc. And I do not know of anyone with the same caliber and guts to do the things he does.
