Epik High is a hip-hop/rap group from South Korea and it comprises of Tablo, DJ Tukutz and Mithra Jin.

I started listening to Epik High because of Tablo, where he appeared in a KBS variety show called "The Return of Superman", which I used to watch [^1].

"Home Is Far Away" is from their ninth studio album "We've Done Something Wonderful" (2017) and it is one of the singles from this album with the other one being [연애소설 (Love Story) ft. IU (어이유)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3INNjAEqHk&list=OLAK5uy_nm2RKQCfBJdmheDbss7RLhRhVO91G6ubE&index=2){:target="_blank"} [^2] where the song ends and transitions to.

This is one of the few songs I listen to when times get tough. Listen to the lyrics (_turn on the caption for English_) and you'll understand why. It may hit you hard to make you realise that "Home Is Far Away". Also, read the comments on this YouTube video.

# The Tablo Podcast

Tablo had a podcast that he did with Dive Studios. Although Tablo recorded its final episode (#56), all the episodes are still available on Apple Podcast, Google Podcast and Spotify (_links are available below_). Do listen to them because Tablo discusses on very interesting and some quite serious topics.

# BONUS: Fan-made Music Film Ft. 소네시대 (Girls Generation)

[Holgacity](https://www.youtube.com/user/holgacity){:target="_blank"}, please correct me if I am wrong, is based in Thailand and they are a big fan of Girls Generation. I have to say that the work they have put in to make all these videos are amazing.

For this music film, they have used Epik High's "Home Is Far Away" as the music. See if you can spot all *nine* of them. Jessica might be a bit hard to find. Otherwise, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AV3FT7G2a4){:target="_blank"} to find out the hidden details.
