> "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music." -- Albert Einstein

Music has always been a passion of mine since young. It all started with Michael Jackson's "Thriller" and "Beat It" in the early 1980's. Growing up, the music that I liked and listened to then were usually the ones that got played the most on the radio, or whatever songs my father plays on his record player.

Along the way, my musical taste has evolved a lot, thanks to my friends' influences, p2p and online streaming services and most importantly YouTube. Now, I find myself listening to a mix of genres and musicians from all across the globe.

There is something that I do differently now when I like a certain song or musician, and that is I would find out more about the song or the story behind the group or musician. I find that this makes me appreciate the song or musician more.

**What This _MUSIC!_** is a platform I created to share everything related to music -- the songs, musicians, and/or the stories that come with it. By sharing, it is one of the ways to support the works of these amazing and talented musicians and pay tribute to them and their work.

Another point is, I always believe that music heals the soul. On tough and trying days, I would usually lie down, close my eyes and let the music do its magic.
