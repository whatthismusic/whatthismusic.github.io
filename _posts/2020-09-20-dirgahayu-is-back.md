Dirgahayu, Malaysia's instrumental rock group, has just announced their new song on Malaysia Day (_16 September, 2020_), Ilhak.

Although many would say Dirgahayu is a [math rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock){:target="_blank"} group, but as Zulhezan highlighted in the interview on the Wknd Sessions, Dirgahayu is an instrumental rock group [^1]. They began as a trio in 2013 with Zulhezan, Afifi Rahim and Wan Azry and Seikan Sawaki joined in 2014 as the fourth member [^2]. With Seikan on the drums, Zul is able to focus on the guitar.

It wasn't until I watched [LIVE // Dirgahayu Farewell Show di ATAS / Seikan Sawaki's Departure - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66JwskOHpdY){:target="_blank"}, that I realised Seikan left the group to return to Japan. It was an emotional performance, for sure, and it's sad to see Dirgahayu without Seikan on the drums. Following that, and as I also got to know when writing this, Zul left the group in 2018 [^3]. No wonder there were no news about the group since then. Even their website is no longer available. The one I have linked here is the one I found in [archive.org](https://archive.org){:target="_blank"}.

On July this year, Dirgahayu announced their new member, [@tiong.faizal](https://www.instagram.com/tiong.faizal/){:target="_blank"} [^4], and now they are comprise of Afifi, Tiong and Wan Azry, as listed on their bandcamp page.

Knowing this and listening to their songs on their Commemorate! album and Ilkhak again, and I can't help to feel that Ilhak does sounds different. Still a good song, nevertheless, and a good start for a new chapter for the group.

With the new member and song, lets hope that they come up with more good materials.

Below is the performance they did on The Wknd (_around 2015_) with three of my favourite Dirgahayu songs -- _几 / 十 六 (Kyu / Ju Roku), Istinggar and Volumetric_. Although it's old, but still it's the best one I could find on YouTube thanks to The Wknd team for the amazing audio and video.
