Yoyoka (よよか) plays the drums like a pro, and she is only ten years old. Another cool fact is she plays in the band "KaneaiYoyoka", which comprises of her family members -- Yoyoka on drums, her mother on guitar, her father on bass and her brother on vocals [^1].

This is one of the latest covers she did (_as of this writing_) and it features Paulie Z on vocals, Brandon Paul on guitar, and Mr. Big's very own Billy Sheehan on bass. Billy is one of the greatest bass players and has played in bands such as Mr. Big, [The Winery Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winery_Dogs){:target="_blank"} and [Sons of Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Apollo){:target="_blank"} just to name a few.

"Take Cover" is from Mr. Big's ["Hey Man"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Man){:target="_blank"} album back in 1996. And this album is their last album with [Paul Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gilbert){:target="_blank"} before his return in the album ["What If..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If..._(Mr._Big_album)){:target="_blank"} [^2].

I bet [Pat Torpey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Torpey){:target="_blank"}, God rest his soul, would be very happy to watch this.
