This is "Lesson Zero", track 1 taken from their new 10th studio album "Epik High Is Here 上" to be released tomorrow.

As Tablo puts it in their "Epik High Is Here" documentary, instead of having a Lesson 6, Tablo says:

> "but after all this time, when looking back, instead of all the things I've wanted to learn and have learned so far, there is more that I need to unlearn.
> So like going in reverse.
> I need to give back some of the things I've learned.
> This is what I've been thinking more and more recently."

Epik High has lessons in their albums starting with their debut album, "Map of the Human Soul".
- "Map of the Human Soul" (Debut studio album) — "Lesson One (Tablo's Word)" [^1]
- "High Society" (Second studio album) — "Lesson 2 (Sunset)" [^2]
- "Swan Songs" (Third studio album) — "Lesson 3 (MC)" [^3]
- "_[e]_" (Sixth studio album) — "Lesson 4" [^4]
